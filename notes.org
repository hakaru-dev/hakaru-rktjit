* Constant values
Added constant values for aggregates(array and values) in sham expressions.
Need a way to create these aggregates before calling our function, and how to pass these constant aggregates to our compiled function
One way is to call LLVMRunFunction (but then we need to cast these into generic value ref, and also I don't know if llvmrunfunction
compiles with optimizations or not

* Time
Maybe we can create a timer function using get_time in our llvm code which calls prog and returns us the time.
also then we need a way to create aggregates and the type of timer will be pair of time and the value returned
by prog
