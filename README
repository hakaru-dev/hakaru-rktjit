racket jit for hakaru simplified

Prerequsites to be installed
llvm v4.0.0
racket v6.9
hakaru latest

Installing sham
git clone git@github.com:rjnw/sham.git
cd ./sham
raco pkg install

git clone git@github.com:rjnw/hakaru-rktjit.git
cd ./hakaru-rktjit
# if no haskell and racket file in ./test directory
./build-test.zsh <file name without hk from hk directory>
./run-test.zsh <test-name> {small,med,big} <docUpdate>

run-test will run both haskell and racket code with same inputs.
Right now every test need to have same function signature as
naive-bayes as the sample inputs I have are for those.
There are three input argument small, med, big. These are in
./test/input directory with format small-arg<n>.csv

New input values can be created using ./create-input.zsh which
needs a couple of arguments like num of topics, doc size etc.
